```{r}
library(plot.practice)
library(ggplot2)
```
First we run the stuff I wrote down.

```{r}
result <- chapter2()
names(result)
```
## Results

Then we look at what I generated using this function.

For starters, I generated some data from an existing dataset.

```{r}
result$data
```

And plotted some of it.

```{r}
result$plots$plot
result$plots$logplot
result$plots$xyzplot
result$plots$coloured
```

I don't know why these won't work, but hey, when I run the function manually,
they do.

```{r}
result$plots$shapes
result$plots$red
result$plots$alpha
```


So those were my findings with chapter 2.
