```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(Sandboxy)
library(ggplot2)
```

First we run the stuff I wrote down.


```{r}
result <- chapter3(mpg)
names(result)
names(result$plots)
```

## Results

Then we look at what I generated using this function.

For starters, I generated some data from an existing dataset.

```{r}
result$data
```

And plotted some of it.

```{r}
result$plots$scatter
result$plots$layered
result$plots$laycol
summary(result$plots$Laycol)
``` 

So those were the things I tried while reading chapter 3.
